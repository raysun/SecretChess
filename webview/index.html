<p>When I was 8, my dad tried to teach me Chinese Chess, but it was too complicated. So instead, he taught me an easier version and I loved it! Today, through the magic of iOS, we bring you this Chinese Chess variant: Secret Chess (aka Banqi in China).</p>

<p>tl;dr - Watch this 5 minute video tutorial. Like SJ said, nobody reads anymore, right?</p>

<h4>
<a name="rules" class="anchor" href="#rules"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rules</h4>

<p>The game works in these modes right now:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 player vs. computer</li>
<li>2 players on a single iPhone or iPad</li>
<li>Coming soon: 2 players over the Internet</li>
</ul>

<img width="80%" src="startBoard.png" />
<p>There are 2 colors, Blue and Red. The color indicator in the bottom left corner shows whose turn it is. The 7 chess pieces shown here are just for reference - beginning players can use this to check how powerful each piece is. They are not part of the actual game.</p>

<p>On your turn, you can either tap an "upside down" piece to turn it up, or you can move a piece of your color 1 space horizontally or vertically. At the start of the game, all pieces are upside down. Note that you might tap an upside down piece and turn up the opponent's piece - that still counts as your turn.</p>

<p>Here's an overview of the pieces, from strongest to weakest:</p>
<img width="80%" src="piecesOnly.png" />
<ol>
<li>   General - there's only 1 for each team</li>
<li>   Advisor - 2</li>
<li>   Elephant - 2</li>
<li>   Chariot - 2</li>
<li>   Horse - 2</li>
<li>   Cannon - 2</li>
<li>   Soldier - 5</li>
</ol><p>Stronger pieces can capture weaker pieces, generally. That is, the General can capture the Advisor, because the General is stronger; and similarly, the Chariot can capture the Solider, and so on. A piece is captured by simply moving your piece on top of the opponent's piece, which has to be 1 space away (except for a special case explained below).</p>

<p>The objective of the game is to capture ALL of the opponent's pieces. Whoever does that first wins the game.</p>

<p>There are 2 exceptions to the rules above, which keep the game more interesting:</p>
<ol>
<li>The General cannot capture the Solider, even though the General is stronger. And in another reality-show-like twist, the Soldier can capture the General. This balances out the game so the General is not all-powerful.</li>
<li>The Cannon has special powers that make it very valuable, even though it is technically 2nd to the weakest. It can move like a normal piece, but it also has an ability that no other pieces have: it can jump over exactly 1 other piece (which can be of the same color, different color, or upside down) and any number of blank spaces and land on an opponent's piece, capturing it. In this jumping case, the Cannon can capture a piece of any strength, not just weaker pieces. Note - the Cannon can only jump if it is capturing - it cannot jump into an empty space.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's an example situation where the Blue Cannon can jump to the right and capture the Red Elephant.</p>

<p>That's it - see, it's simple - have fun, and please send us feedback!</p>
